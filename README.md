This repository gathers theme-specific templates for Groups Newsletters.


Themes
------

If you would like to adjust the way things are displayed, you can use WordPress’ template system to customize how stories and newsletters are rendered. Depending on the theme, specific templates for stories and newsletters might be needed to display these correctly.

In your active theme, add a groups-newsletters folder. You can provide template files in that folder for the type of page you want to customize, for example:

`single-story.php` used to display a story
`taxonomy-newsletter.php` used to display a newsletter

Default templates, which can also be used to derive your own, are provided in the plugin’s templates folder.
Included are default `single-story.php` and `taxonomy-newsletter.php` templates.
